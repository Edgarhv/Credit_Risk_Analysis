# Overview

Credit Risk is a real-world challenge. In this Project, we predict credit risk with several machine learning models. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.

# Results

- Naive Random Oversampling results:
The balanced accuracy test is 66%,the precision for the high_risk has a very low positivity at 1% and the recall is 70%.

- SMOTE oversampling results:
the accuracy score is 66.2%, the precision for the high_risk loans has a low positvity again at 1% and recall is 69% overall
